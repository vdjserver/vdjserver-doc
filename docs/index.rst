VDJServer Documentation
=======================

VDJServer is a free, scalable resource for performing immune repertoire analysis
and sharing data. It provides access to a suite of tools for a complete
analysis workflow, including modules for preprocessing and quality
control of sequence reads, V(D)J gene segment assignment, repertoire
characterization, and repertoire comparison. VDJServer also provides
sophisticated visualizations for exploratory analysis. It is accessible
through a standard web browser via a graphical user interface designed
for use by immunologists, clinicians, and bioinformatics researchers.

VDJServer is a large repository in the AIRR Data Commons, and as of
December, 2021 (CDP Release), contains 39 studies, 3408 repertoires and ~2.5B rearrangements
(annotated sequences). VDJServer provides the functionality to publicly
share your study and sequence data, as well as privately share data between users.
