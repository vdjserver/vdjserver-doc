VDJServer Documentation
=======================

VDJServer is a free, scalable resource for performing immune repertoire analysis

control of sequence reads, V(D)J gene segment assignment, repertoire
characterization, and repertoire comparison. VDJServer also provides
sophisticated visualizations for exploratory analysis. It is accessible
through a standard web browser via a graphical user interface designed
for use by immunologists, clinicians, and bioinformatics researchers.
